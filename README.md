**Overview**

This project will showcase a Bluetooth-based Presence Detection Sensor developed using the Silicon Labs EFR32BG22 Bluetooth Explorer Kit. The primary objective of this example is to make a presence detection measurement every 5 seconds when the Bluetooth connection is established. This means that the sensor will detect the presence of any object or entity in its range at regular intervals of 5 seconds.

The BLE EFR Connect app detects any presence in the sensor. This app displays the measurement results in real-time, allowing users to view an object or entity's detected presence instantly. This feature makes the sensor ideal for applications where real-time monitoring of an object's presence is critical.

The sensor relies on an STHS34PF30-STMicroelectronics I2C connection for communication. This sensor is known for its high accuracy and low power consumption, making it an ideal choice for its implementation. Moreover, the sensor's I2C interface allows easy integration with the EFR32BG22 Bluetooth Explorer Kit and the BLE EFR Connect app.

This example sensor is optimized for low power consumption and can be used in EM3 and EM4 modes to detect the presence of an object. These modes are known for their ultra-low power consumption, making the sensor ideal for battery-powered applications.
